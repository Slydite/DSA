# Pattern 2: Implementation with Other Data Structures

This pattern involves implementing a data structure using the properties of another. These problems are common interview questions to test the understanding of the fundamental operations (LIFO for stacks, FIFO for queues) and the ability to manipulate data flows.

### 1. Implement Stack using Queues
`[EASY]` `#implementation` `#queue` `#stack`

#### Problem Statement
Implement a LIFO stack using only one or two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

#### Implementation Overview
The goal is to make the queue, a FIFO structure, behave in a LIFO manner. The key is to re-arrange the queue elements on every push or pop so that the desired element is at the front.

**Method 1: Making `push` costly (O(N)) using a single queue**
This is the most common approach. The idea is to make the newest element the front of the queue after every push.
1.  **Push `x`**:
    - Get the current size of the queue, say `s`.
    - Enqueue the new element `x`.
    - Dequeue the first `s` elements and immediately enqueue them back to the rear of the queue. This rotation moves the new element `x` to the front.
2.  **Pop**: Dequeue from the front of the queue. This is O(1).
3.  **Top**: Peek at the front of the queue. This is O(1).

**Method 2: Making `pop` costly (O(N)) using a single queue**
1. **Push `x`**: Simply enqueue the element. This is O(1).
2. **Pop**: To get the last element, we must dequeue and re-enqueue all but the last element.
   - Dequeue `size - 1` elements and add them to the back.
   - The element now at the front is the one we want. Dequeue and return it.
   - This is an O(N) operation.

#### Python Code Snippet (Method 1: Costly Push)
```python
from collections import deque

class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # Add the new element to the back
        self.q.append(x)
        # Rotate the queue to make the new element the front
        for _ in range(len(self.q) - 1):
            self.q.append(self.q.popleft())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        if not self.empty():
            return self.q.popleft()
        return -1 # Or raise exception

    def top(self) -> int:
        if not self.empty():
            return self.q[0]
        return -1

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.q
```

### 2. Implement Queue using Stacks
`[EASY]` `#implementation` `#stack` `#queue`

#### Problem Statement
Implement a FIFO queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push` (enqueue), `peek` (front), `pop` (dequeue), and `empty`).

#### Implementation Overview
This is a classic problem that uses an **amortized O(1)** approach with two stacks, often named `input` and `output`.
- The `input` stack is for `push` operations. All new elements go here.
- The `output` stack is for `pop` and `peek` operations. It holds elements in reversed (queue-like) order.

The core idea is to transfer elements from `input` to `output` **only when the `output` stack is empty**. This reverses their order, making the first element that went into the `input` stack become the top element of the `output` stack.

1.  **Push `x`**: Simply push `x` onto the `input` stack. This is always an O(1) operation.
2.  **Pop/Peek**:
    - First, check if the `output` stack is empty.
    - If `output` is empty, pop every element from `input` and push it onto `output`. This O(N) transfer operation only happens occasionally.
    - If `output` is not empty (or after the transfer), `pop` or `peek` from the `output` stack. This is an O(1) operation.

#### Python Code Snippet (Amortized)
```python
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.input_stack.append(x)

    # Helper function to transfer elements when needed
    def _transfer_if_needed(self):
        if not self.output_stack:
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        self._transfer_if_needed()
        if self.output_stack:
            return self.output_stack.pop()
        return -1 # Or raise exception

    def peek(self) -> int:
        self._transfer_if_needed()
        if self.output_stack:
            return self.output_stack[-1]
        return -1

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.input_stack and not self.output_stack
```

#### Tricks/Gotchas
- **Amortized Analysis**: The efficiency of this implementation comes from the amortized analysis. While a single `pop` or `peek` can be O(N), it only happens when the `output` stack is empty. Over a series of `n` operations, the total time is proportional to `n`, making the average time per operation O(1).
- **Common Mistake**: A common error is to transfer elements back and forth on every operation, which would be highly inefficient. The key is to **only** move elements from `input` to `output` when `output` is exhausted.
