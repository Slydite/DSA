# Pattern 2: Modification of BST Structure

This pattern covers problems that involve altering the structure of the Binary Search Tree. This includes adding new nodes (insertion), removing existing nodes (deletion), and constructing a BST from a given traversal sequence. These operations must be performed carefully to maintain the fundamental properties of the BST at all times.

### 6. Insert a given Node in Binary Search Tree
`[EASY]` `#bst` `#traversal` `#modification`

#### Problem Statement
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree and a value to insert, insert the value into the BST. Return the root of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

*Example:*
- **Input:** `root = [4,2,7,1,3]`, `val = 5`
- **Output:** `[4,2,7,1,3,5]`

#### Implementation Overview
We traverse the tree to find the correct empty spot for the new node. This can be done recursively or iteratively.

**Iterative Approach:**
1.  Handle the empty tree case: if the `root` is `null`, the new node becomes the root.
2.  Start a traversal from the `root` with a `current` pointer.
3.  Loop until a `null` link is found. At each step, compare `val` with `current.val`:
    -   If `val < current.val`, move left. If `current.left` is `null`, this is the insertion point.
    -   If `val > current.val`, move right. If `current.right` is `null`, this is the insertion point.

**Recursive Approach:**
1.  The function returns the node that should be placed at a certain position.
2.  If the current `root` is `null`, we've found the insertion point. Return a new `TreeNode(val)`.
3.  If `val < root.val`, recursively call on the left subtree: `root.left = insert_into_bst(root.left, val)`.
4.  If `val > root.val`, recursively call on the right subtree: `root.right = insert_into_bst(root.right, val)`.
5.  Return the (possibly modified) `root`.

#### Python Code Snippet (Iterative)
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def insert_into_bst_iterative(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        return TreeNode(val)

    current = root
    while True:
        if val < current.val:
            if not current.left:
                current.left = TreeNode(val)
                break
            current = current.left
        else: # val > current.val (assuming no duplicates)
            if not current.right:
                current.right = TreeNode(val)
                break
            current = current.right

    return root
```

### 7. Delete a Node in Binary Search Tree
`[MEDIUM]` `#bst` `#traversal` `#modification`

#### Problem Statement
Given a root node of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root of the BST.

#### Implementation Overview
Deletion is the most complex foundational operation. It involves finding the node and then handling three cases based on its children.
1.  **Find the Node:** First, search for the node with the given `key` using a recursive approach.
2.  **Handle Deletion Cases:** Once the node is found (`key == root.val`):
    -   **Case 1: The node is a leaf (no children).** This is the simplest case. Simply return `None` to the parent call, which effectively removes the node.
    -   **Case 2: The node has one child.** Replace the node with its single child by returning the existing child to the parent call.
    -   **Case 3: The node has two children.** This is the tricky case. To maintain the BST property, we must replace the node's value with either its **in-order successor** (the smallest value in its right subtree) or its **in-order predecessor**.
        a. Let's use the in-order successor. Find the minimum value in the node's right subtree.
        b. Copy this successor's value into the node we want to delete.
        c. Now, the tree has a duplicate value. Recursively call the delete function on the right subtree to remove the successor node. This recursive deletion is guaranteed to fall into Case 1 or Case 2.

#### Python Code Snippet
```python
def find_min_val_node(node: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    current = node
    while current and current.left:
        current = current.left
    return current

def delete_node(root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        return None

    if key < root.val:
        root.left = delete_node(root.left, key)
    elif key > root.val:
        root.right = delete_node(root.right, key)
    else: # key == root.val, this is the node to be deleted
        # Case 1 & 2: Node with 0 or 1 child
        if not root.left:
            return root.right
        elif not root.right:
            return root.left

        # Case 3: Node with two children
        # Find the in-order successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        successor = find_min_val_node(root.right)
        # Copy the successor's value to this node
        root.val = successor.val
        # Delete the in-order successor from the right subtree
        root.right = delete_node(root.right, successor.val)

    return root
```

### 11. Construct a BST from a Preorder Traversal
`[MEDIUM]` `#bst` `#construction` `#preorder`

#### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `preorder`, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST, construct the tree and return its root.

*Example:*
- **Input:** `preorder = [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]`
- **Output:** The root of the BST: `[8,5,10,1,7,null,12]`

#### Implementation Overview
The first element in a preorder traversal is always the root of the tree/subtree. The subsequent elements are then split into the left subtree (all values smaller than the root) and the right subtree (all values larger than the root). A naive O(N^2) solution involves finding these splits for each node. The optimal O(N) solution uses bounds to place each node correctly.

1.  We use a global index `i` to keep track of our position in the `preorder` array.
2.  We define a recursive helper function `build(lower_bound, upper_bound)`.
3.  The `root` of the current `build` call is `preorder[i]`. We must check if this value is within the `(lower_bound, upper_bound)` range for the current position in the tree. If not, we can't place it here, so we return `null`.
4.  If the value is valid, create a new `TreeNode`. Increment the global index `i`.
5.  Recursively build the left subtree. The new bounds for the left child are `(lower_bound, node.val)`.
6.  Recursively build the right subtree. The new bounds for the right child are `(node.val, upper_bound)`.
7.  The initial call is `build(float('-inf'), float('inf'))`.

#### Python Code Snippet (Optimal O(N))
```python
class Solution:
    def bstFromPreorder(self, preorder: list[int]) -> TreeNode:
        self.i = 0

        def build(lower_bound, upper_bound):
            if self.i >= len(preorder):
                return None

            val = preorder[self.i]
            # Check if the current value is valid for this position
            if not (lower_bound < val < upper_bound):
                return None

            # This value is the root of the current subtree
            self.i += 1
            node = TreeNode(val)

            # The left child's upper bound is the current node's value
            node.left = build(lower_bound, val)
            # The right child's lower bound is the current node's value
            node.right = build(val, upper_bound)

            return node

        return build(float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

#### Tricks/Gotchas
- **State Management:** The key to the O(N) solution is managing the state efficiently. Using a global index for the `preorder` array and passing `min/max` bounds recursively avoids re-scanning the array.
- **Alternative Solution:** A simpler to write, but less optimal, O(N log N) solution is to just iterate through the `preorder` array and insert each element into a BST using the standard insertion algorithm. This is a good fallback if the optimal solution is difficult to remember.
