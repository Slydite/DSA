# Pattern 1: Foundational Traversals

This pattern covers the essential traversal algorithms for binary trees, which form the basis for solving a wide range of tree problems. It includes recursive and iterative approaches for Depth-First (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order) and Breadth-First (Level-order) traversals.
