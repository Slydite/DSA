# Pattern 2: Tree Views & Boundary Traversals

This pattern groups problems that require viewing or traversing the binary tree in a specific, non-standard order. These problems often build upon foundational traversals (like Level-order) but add extra logic to track coordinates, levels, or boundaries.

### 1. Zig Zag Traversal of Binary Tree
`[EASY]` `#traversal` `#level-order` `#bfs` `#queue` `#deque`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of Zig Zag (or Spiral) Level-order traversal, alternating direction at each level.)*

---

### 2. Boundary Traversal of Binary Tree
`[MEDIUM]` `#traversal` `#boundary`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of the anti-clockwise boundary traversal, which involves printing the left boundary, all leaf nodes, and the right boundary in reverse.)*

---

### 3. Vertical Order Traversal of Binary Tree
`[EASY]` `#traversal` `#level-order` `#coordinates` `#hashmap`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of vertical order traversal, where nodes in the same vertical line are grouped together.)*

---

### 4. Top View of Binary Tree
`[EASY]` `#traversal` `#view` `#coordinates` `#hashmap`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of how to find the top view, which consists of the first node seen from the top at each vertical line.)*

---

### 5. Bottom View of Binary Tree
`[MEDIUM]` `#traversal` `#view` `#coordinates` `#hashmap`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of how to find the bottom view, which consists of the last node seen from the top at each vertical line.)*

---

### 6. Right/Left View of Binary Tree
`[MEDIUM]` `#traversal` `#view` `#level-order`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of how to find the right or left view, which consists of the last or first node seen at each level.)*
