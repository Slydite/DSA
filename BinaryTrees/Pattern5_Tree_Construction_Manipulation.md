# Pattern 5: Tree Construction & Manipulation

This pattern covers problems where the primary goal is to construct a binary tree from a given representation (like traversal arrays) or to fundamentally manipulate its structure (like flattening it into a linked list). These problems test understanding of how traversals uniquely define a tree's structure.

### 1. Count total Nodes in a COMPLETE Binary Tree
`[MEDIUM]` `#recursion` `#complete-tree` `#properties`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of the efficient solution for counting nodes in a complete binary tree by leveraging its properties to avoid traversing the entire tree.)*

---

### 2. Construct Binary Tree from inorder and preorder
`[HARD]` `#recursion` `#construction` `#inorder` `#preorder`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of the classic recursive algorithm to construct a unique binary tree from its pre-order and in-order traversals.)*

---

### 3. Construct the Binary Tree from Postorder and Inorder Traversal
`[HARD]` `#recursion` `#construction` `#inorder` `#postorder`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of the algorithm to construct a unique binary tree from its post-order and in-order traversals, similar to the pre-order/in-order version but with slight modifications.)*

---

### 4. Serialize and deserialize Binary Tree
`[HARD]` `#serialization` `#traversal`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of how to convert a binary tree to a string representation (serialize) and then restore the tree from that string (deserialize), often using a pre-order traversal.)*

---

### 5. Flatten Binary Tree to LinkedList
`[HARD]` `#manipulation` `#recursion` `#morris-traversal`

#### Problem Statement
*(Explanation of how to flatten a binary tree into a pre-order "linked list" in-place, discussing both recursive and iterative (Morris Traversal based) solutions.)*
