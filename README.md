# DSA & System Design Notes

This repository serves as a comprehensive, structured knowledge base for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and System Design.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) - Striver 450 Deconstructed

This section focuses on the popular **Striver 450** problem list, but:

*   **Solution-Pattern Driven:** Problems are meticulously *recategorized* based on their underlying solution patterns rather than just data structures.
*   **In-depth Analysis:** Each problem features a detailed breakdown, including:
    *   Problem Statement & Examples
    *   Implementation Overview (step-by-step logic)
    *   Python Code Snippets (for key problems)
    *   Tricks & Gotchas
    *   Related Problems
*   **Clear Tagging:** Problems are annotated with `[FLAGS]` (e.g., `[FUNDAMENTAL]`, `[MEDIUM]`) and `#solution-tags` (e.g., `#two-pointers`, `#hashmap`) for easy navigation and understanding.
