# What'S An Event Driven System？ (720P60) - Part 1

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

![Screenshot at 00:00:00](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-00-00.jpg)

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a software design pattern where components communicate indirectly by producing and consuming **events**. Unlike traditional **Request-Response** architectures where services make direct calls to each other and expect an immediate reply, EDA promotes a decoupled and asynchronous communication model.

#### Request-Response vs. Event-Driven Communication

The fundamental difference lies in how services interact:

| Feature              | Request-Response Architecture                               | Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)                                  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communication**    | **Direct, synchronous calls** (e.g., API calls, RPC). A service requests an action and waits for a response. | **Indirect, asynchronous communication** via events. A service publishes an event, and interested services react to it. |
| **Coupling**         | **Tightly coupled**: The caller service needs to know the callee service's address and interface. Failure in one can block the other. | **Loosely coupled**: Services only need to know the event structure. Producers don't know who consumes their events, and consumers don't know who produces them. |
| **Flow**             | Typically **linear and sequential**. A chain of requests can form a dependency path. | **Reactive and parallel**. Events can trigger multiple independent reactions simultaneously. |
| **Scalability**      | Can be challenging to scale individual services independently without affecting dependent callers. | Easier to scale: New consumers can subscribe to events without modifying existing producers, and vice versa. |
| **Resilience**       | A failure in a downstream service can immediately impact the upstream caller. | Events can be persisted and replayed. Services can recover from failures and process events later, improving fault tolerance. |

#### Core Components of EDA

At the heart of an EDA are three main components:

*   **Events:** An event is a notification that "something significant has happened" within a system. It's a factual record of a state change, not a command to perform an action.
    *   *Analogy:* Think of a news headline. It simply states what occurred ("New Product Launched!"), allowing anyone interested to read further and react if relevant.
*   **Producers (Publishers):** These are services or components that detect a change in their state or perform an action, and then generate and send (publish) an event to an Event Bus. They don't care who consumes the event.
    *   *Analogy:* A journalist reporting a story. They write the news and submit it to the news agency.
*   **Consumers (Subscribers):** These are services or components that express interest in specific types of events. They listen to the Event Bus, consume relevant events, and then react to them, potentially changing their own internal state or producing new events.
    *   *Analogy:* Readers subscribing to a newspaper or a specific news feed because they are interested in particular topics (e.g., "tech news").

*   **Event Bus (or Message Broker):** This is the central communication channel that facilitates the flow of events from producers to consumers. It acts as an intermediary, ensuring events are delivered reliably. Services publish events *to* the Event Bus and consume events *from* it, avoiding direct service-to-service communication.
    *   *Analogy:* The news agency itself, which receives reports from journalists and distributes them to all interested subscribers.

    style ClientEmail fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

As depicted above, a client's initial request is handled by a gateway service. This service then publishes an event (`OrderCreated`) to the Event Bus. Multiple other services (e.g., `OrderProcessor`, `InventoryUpdater`) can independently consume this event and perform their respective tasks. These services might then publish new events (`OrderProcessed`, `InventoryUpdated`), which another service (like an `EmailNotifier`) can consume to send a confirmation email. This chain of asynchronous event processing is a hallmark of EDA.

#### Relationship with Publish-Subscribe

EDA is closely related to and often implemented using the **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** messaging pattern. In Pub/Sub, publishers send messages to specific topics or channels, and subscribers receive messages from topics they are subscribed to. The Event Bus often embodies this Pub/Sub mechanism. While very similar, the term "Event-Driven Architecture" typically implies a broader architectural style where events drive the entire system's behavior, not just a messaging pattern.

### Real-World Applications of Event-Driven Architecture

EDA is a powerful paradigm used in various systems for its flexibility, scalability, and resilience:

*   **Git:** Version control systems like Git are inherently event-driven. Each **commit** is an event that records a snapshot of changes, building a historical timeline of the project.
*   **React (and other UI Frameworks):** Modern front-end frameworks like React operate on an event-driven model. User interactions (e.g., clicks, key presses, form submissions) generate events, which components listen for and react to, triggering UI updates.
*   **Node.js:** The asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model of Node.js is built around events. Operations (like file reads or network requests) emit events upon completion, which are then handled by callback functions.
*   **Gaming Systems:** Many multiplayer online games use EDA to manage player actions, synchronize game states across distributed clients and servers, and ensure fairness in real-time interactions.

#### Case Study: Ensuring Fairness in First-Person Shooter (FPS) Games

Consider a scenario in a fast-paced multiplayer FPS game (like Counter-Strike) involving Player 1, Player 2, and a central game server.

**The Latency Problem in Traditional Systems:**

Imagine Player 1 aims precisely at Player 2's head and fires a "headshot" at a specific moment in time `T` (from Player 1's perspective).
1.  **Player 1's Client Action:** Player 1's client sends a "shot" request to the server, indicating Player 2's perceived position (e.g., **Position 9**) at time `T`.
2.  **Network Delay:** Due to network latency, this request takes some time to reach the server.
3.  **Player 2's Movement:** In the short interval while Player 1's shot is in transit, Player 2 might have moved (e.g., from Position 9 to **Position 10**) and updated their position with the server.
4.  **Server Evaluation:** When Player 1's shot request finally arrives at the server, the server evaluates it against Player 2's *current* position (Position 10).
5.  **Unfair Outcome:** The server determines it's *not* a headshot because Player 2 is no longer at Position 9, leading to an unfair "miss" for Player 1, even though they accurately aimed at time `T`.

**The Event-Driven Solution:**

EDA provides a robust solution to this fairness challenge by treating all player actions and movements as **timestamped events**.

1.  **Timestamped Events:** When Player 1 takes a shot, an event is generated (e.g., `ShotEvent: {shooterId: P1, targetId: P2, targetPosition: P9, eventTime: T}`). Similarly, Player 2's movements are also timestamped events. All these events are sent to the server.
2.  **Event Stream and Replayability:** The server doesn't just store the *current* state; it maintains a detailed, ordered log or stream of all game events with their precise timestamps. This is often called **Event Sourcing**.
3.  **State Reconstruction for Validation:** To validate Player 1's shot fairly, the server can:
    *   **Reconstruct Past State:** When Player 1's `ShotEvent` arrives, the server can effectively "rewind" or reconstruct the game state as it existed at `eventTime: T` by processing all events up to that specific timestamp.
    *   **Fair Evaluation:** At the reconstructed state for time `T`, if Player 2 was indeed at `Position 9`, the server can then correctly determine it was a headshot, regardless of Player 2's current position.

This ability to reconstruct historical states from a sequence of timestamped events is a powerful feature of event-driven systems. It ensures fairness by validating actions against the state that existed at the precise moment the action occurred, mitigating the impact of network latency in real-time applications.

### How Event-Driven Architecture Works in Practice

![Screenshot at 00:03:50](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-03-50.jpg)

In an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), services communicate indirectly through events, fostering a highly decoupled system. Let's trace a typical flow:

1.  **Initial Request:** A client sends a request (e.g., to create an order) to **Service 1**.
2.  **Event Publishing:** After processing the request, Service 1 publishes an **event** (e.g., `OrderCreatedEvent`) to the **Event Bus**. Service 1's role as a producer ends here; it doesn't wait for other services to react.
3.  **Event Consumption:** The Event Bus then delivers this event to all interested **consumer services**, such as **Service 2** and **Service 3**. Each consumer service receives a copy of the event.
4.  **Local Data Storage & Processing:**
    *   A critical aspect of many EDA implementations is that each consuming service (e.g., Service 2, Service 3) **stores the received event in its own local database**.
    *   This local storage is not strictly compulsory but is a common and beneficial practice. It allows the service to persist the event data, combine it with its own internal state, and process it asynchronously.
    *   Services can choose to store the entire event, or only relevant fields, potentially adding their own specific metadata.
    *   *Analogy:* Imagine a central library (Event Bus) receiving new books (events). Instead of just reading a book and forgetting it, each reader (service) who finds a book interesting takes a copy and puts it in their personal library (local database) for future reference and processing.

```
This local persistence differentiates EDA from a typical **microservice architecture** where services generally only store data that they *own* and are solely responsible for. In EDA, services often store a subset of data or events originating from other services if that data is relevant to their specific domain or processing logic. This design ensures that services can operate independently, even if the original event-producing service or the Event Bus is temporarily unavailable.

#### Advantages of Event-Driven Architecture

EDA offers several significant benefits for building robust and scalable systems:

1.  **High Availability:**
    *   Because each service stores the events it needs locally, it doesn't have to repeatedly query other services for information.
    *   If a service that originally *produced* an event goes down, or if the Event Bus experiences a temporary outage, consuming services can continue to operate using their locally stored event data. This significantly improves the overall availability of the system.
    *   *Analogy:* If a news reporter (producer) is unavailable, you can still read their past articles from your saved newspaper collection (local database).

2.  **Enhanced Debugging and Time Travel (Event Sourcing):**
    *   By treating all state changes as a sequence of immutable, timestamped events (often called an **Event Log** or **Event Stream**), EDA enables powerful debugging capabilities.
    *   You can "replay" events from any point in time to reconstruct the system's state at that specific moment. This is invaluable for:
        *   **Debugging Production Issues:** If a bug is identified that started after a certain timestamp, you can replay events up to that timestamp and then step through subsequent events to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue in a controlled environment.
        *   **Auditing:** The event log provides a complete, immutable history of everything that has happened in the system.
        *   **Analytics:** Historical events can be used for deep data analysis and reporting.

3.  **Seamless Service Replacement and Upgrades:**
    *   EDA makes it remarkably easy to replace or upgrade services without downtime or complex data migrations.
    *   **Process:** If you need to replace `Service 2` with a new `Service 5`:
        1.  Deploy `Service 5`.
        2.  `Service 5` requests all historical events from `timestamp zero` up to the current time from the Event Bus.
        3.  `Service 5` "replays" these historical events, processing them one by one to build its internal state, making it consistent with `Service 2`'s historical state.
        4.  Once caught up, `Service 5` starts consuming new, live events from the Event Bus.
        5.  `Service 2` can then be gracefully decommissioned.
    *   This "replayability" eliminates the need for complex, synchronized data transfers between services during upgrades, leading to smoother and less risky deployments.

4.  **Transactional Guarantees (Distributed Transactions):**
    *   While achieving strong transactional guarantees (like ACID properties) across distributed services is challenging, EDA provides patterns to manage **distributed transactions** and ensure eventual consistency.
    *   One common approach is the **Outbox Pattern**, where a service publishes an event to its local database *as part of the same transaction* that updates its business state. A separate process then reliably forwards these events to the Event Bus. This ensures that either both the state change and the event publication succeed, or both fail, preventing lost events.
    *   *Analogy:* When you write a check (business transaction), you also record it in your checkbook (event). You wouldn't send the check without recording it, and vice versa.

#### Disadvantage: Eventual Consistency

While EDA offers high availability and decoupling, it inherently leads to **eventual consistency**.

*   **Definition:** Eventual consistency means that while data will eventually become consistent across all services, there might be a temporary period where different services have slightly different views of the data.
*   **Reason:** Since services process events asynchronously and update their local states independently, there's a delay between when an event is published by one service and when it's fully processed and reflected in the local databases of all consuming services.
*   *Example:* If `Service 1` updates a user's status and publishes an event, `Service 2` might still show the old status for a brief period until it processes that event.
*   **Implication:** This requires careful design to ensure that applications can tolerate temporary inconsistencies, or that compensating actions are in place for critical paths. It's a trade-off for the benefits of decoupling and availability.

### Message Delivery Guarantees in EDA

![Screenshot at 00:07:39](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-07-39.jpg)

Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) provide flexibility in message delivery guarantees, allowing developers to choose the appropriate level of reliability based on the criticality of the event. These guarantees typically fall into two categories:

1.  **At Most Once Delivery (Fire-and-Forget):**
    *   **Description:** The event is sent to the Event Bus, but there's no guarantee it will be successfully delivered to the consumer or processed. If it fails, it's not retried.
    *   **Use Case:** Suitable for non-critical events where occasional loss is acceptable.
    *   *Example:* Sending a "Welcome Email" to a new user. If it fails, the user might not get it immediately, but it's not catastrophic. The system doesn't incur the overhead of retries.

2.  **At Least Once Delivery (Guaranteed Delivery):**
    *   **Description:** The event is guaranteed to be delivered to the consumer at least once. If delivery fails initially (e.g., consumer is down), the Event Bus (or the producer's logic) will retry until successful. This might result in duplicate deliveries if the consumer receives the event but fails to acknowledge it, or if retries occur before acknowledgement is processed.
    *   **Use Case:** Essential for critical events where data loss is unacceptable.
    *   *Example:* Sending an "Invoice Email" or processing a financial transaction. You *must* ensure the event is processed. This typically involves retry mechanisms within the Event Bus or the producer's logic. Consumers must be designed to be **idempotent**, meaning processing the same event multiple times has the same effect as processing it once (e.g., checking if an invoice is already sent before sending it again).

This choice provides a transactional guarantee at the message level, ensuring that events are handled with the appropriate level of reliability.

#### Intent-Driven Data Processing

A powerful aspect of storing events locally is that services are not just storing data; they are storing the *intent* behind the data. The sequence of events (`OrderCreated`, `OrderUpdated`, `OrderCancelled`) tells a story.

*   **Flexibility in Logic:** Because a service has access to the full historical event log, it can interpret and process these events in different ways. If `Service 5` replaces `Service 2`, it can replay the same events but apply entirely new business logic or derive a different aggregate state, offering significant flexibility for future enhancements or changes in business requirements.
*   **Decoupling of Logic from Data Source:** The consumer service's logic is primarily driven by the events it receives, not by direct queries to the original data source. This promotes stronger decoupling.

### Disadvantages and Challenges of Event-Driven Architecture

While EDA offers many advantages, it also introduces complexities and trade-offs:

1.  **Challenges with External System Interactions (Non-Idempotent Operations):**
    *   **Problem:** Replacing services that interact with external systems (like `Service 4` sending emails via an external email API) becomes problematic when replaying historical events.
    *   **Reason:** If `Service 4` is replaced by `Service 4_new` and `Service 4_new` replays past `EmailSendEvent`s, it will attempt to send emails again. External systems are typically not idempotent; sending the same email twice will result in duplicate emails to the client, which is undesirable.
    *   **Solution Complexity:** To handle this, you might need to store timestamps of external responses or design the external interaction to be idempotent from the service's perspective (e.g., only send an email if it hasn't been sent before for a specific transaction ID). This adds significant complexity and might not always be feasible, especially with third-party APIs.
    *   *Analogy:* If you mail a physical letter (external interaction), replaying the "mail letter" event means mailing another physical letter, which is usually not what you want.

2.  **Reduced Control and Predictability:**
    *   **Problem:** Unlike Request-Response, where you have direct control over which service receives a request and can expect a synchronous response, EDA's asynchronous nature means less fine-grained control over event flow.
    *   **Event Bus Dependency:** The delivery time of an event depends on the Event Bus's queueing, processing, and delivery mechanisms. Even if priorities are set, there's no strict guarantee of immediate processing, which can be an issue for latency-sensitive operations.
    *   **Difficulty in Tracing:** Debugging a chain of events across multiple services can be more challenging than tracing a synchronous request-response call stack. Correlating events across different services requires robust distributed tracing mechanisms.
    *   *Analogy:* Sending a letter via post (event) versus making a direct phone call (request-response). With a letter, you don't know exactly when it will arrive or who will handle it along the way; with a phone call, you have immediate feedback.

3.  **Determining What Constitutes an Event:**
    *   **Problem:** It can be challenging to decide which internal state changes within a service should be published as events.
    *   **Granularity:** Publishing too many fine-grained events can lead to "event noise" and overwhelm the Event Bus and consumers. Publishing too few might miss critical state changes that other services need.
    *   **Consumer Needs:** It's difficult to predict all future consumer needs. What one service considers irrelevant data, another might need. This can lead to either over-publishing or under-publishing events.
    *   **Access Control:** Implementing fine-grained access control on events (e.g., only allowing certain services to consume specific events) adds significant complexity to the Event Bus implementation. It moves away from the simple "publish and subscribe" model.

4.  **Storage and Replay Complexity:**
    *   **Problem:** While storing all events for replayability is an advantage, managing and storing a potentially massive event log over long periods can be complex and costly.
    *   **Schema Evolution:** As systems evolve, event schemas might change. Replaying old events with new service logic or schema versions can become a significant challenge, potentially requiring complex data migrations or versioning strategies.
    *   **Performance:** Replaying a very long history of events can be time-consuming, especially for services that need to rebuild their entire state from scratch. This might necessitate snapshots or other optimization techniques.

### Overcoming Event Log Replay Challenges

![Screenshot at 00:12:26](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-12-26.jpg)

While the ability to replay events from an event log is a powerful feature for debugging and service replacement, replaying the *entire* history of events from the beginning (timestamp zero) can be impractical for systems with a large volume of events. To address this, there are alternative approaches:

1.  **Replay from Start (Full Replay):**
    *   **Concept:** Process every single event from the very first event recorded in the system's history to reconstruct the current state.
    *   **Feasibility:** Highly impractical for most real-world systems due to the sheer volume of events. It would take an unacceptably long time and consume vast computing resources.

2.  **Diff-based Replay (Undo/Redo):**
    *   **Concept:** Instead of replaying all events from the start, this method involves taking a known good state (e.g., a snapshot) and then applying only the *differences* (events) that occurred since that snapshot. It can also involve "undoing" specific operations to revert to a previous state.
    *   **Applicability:** Works well for operations that are easily reversible (e.g., addition/subtraction in a financial ledger).
    *   **Limitations:** Not all operations are easily undoable. For example, sending an email cannot be "undone" once it has left the system.

3.  **Event Compaction (Squashing):**
    *   **Concept:** Periodically, groups of historical events are "compacted" or "squashed" into a single, summarized event or a new snapshot. This reduces the total number of events that need to be replayed to reach a particular point in time.
    *   **Mechanism:** For example, instead of storing every single stock trade, you might compact all trades for a particular stock for a day into a single "End-of-Day Stock Summary" event.
    *   **Benefit:** Greatly reduces the replay time. If you want to go back to a specific day, you can load the compacted state for the previous day and then replay only the events from the target day onwards.
    *   This technique effectively turns a potential disadvantage (long replay times) into a manageable one, making it a "disadvantage which can be overcome."

### Developer-Centric Disadvantages of EDA

Beyond technical challenges, EDA introduces complexities for development teams:

1.  **Difficulty in Reasoning About System Flow (Hidden Flow):**
    *   **Problem:** In an EDA, the control flow is **decentralized and implicit**. When a service publishes an event, its code doesn't explicitly state which other services will consume it or what actions they will take.
    *   **Debugging Challenge:** A developer looking at `Service 1`'s code will only see that it publishes an event to the Event Bus. To understand the full chain of reactions, they must then inspect the Event Bus configuration to see which services subscribe to that event, and then examine the code of each subscribing service.
    *   **Impact:** This makes it harder to understand the overall system behavior, trace issues, and onboard new developers. The "flow" of execution is not immediately apparent from the code of individual services.
    *   *Analogy:* It's like sending a message to a public bulletin board. You know you've posted it, but you don't instantly know who reads it or how they'll react. To find out, you'd have to observe every person passing by.

2.  **Difficulty in Transitioning Out of EDA (Architectural Commitment):**
    *   **Problem:** Once a system is built with an event-driven paradigm, it becomes very challenging to shift parts of it back to a Request-Response model.
    *   **Reason:** The entire system is designed around asynchronous, decoupled event processing. Introducing synchronous requests would require significant architectural changes, potentially breaking the core communication patterns and data consistency models.
    *   **Rigidity:** The benefits of EDA (like eventual consistency and decoupled services) often come with a commitment to its principles. Attempting to mix paradigms can lead to hybrid systems that inherit the complexities of both without fully realizing the benefits of either.

### Conclusion: The Core Difference

![Screenshot at 00:12:37](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-12-37.jpg)
![Screenshot at 00:12:48](notes_screenshots/refined_What's_an_Event_Driven_System？-(720p60)_screenshots/frame_00-12-48.jpg)

At its heart, the distinction between Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Request-Response (R/R) architecture boils down to a fundamental difference in communication intent:

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Services **publish events** when "something has happened" that others *might* need to know about. They announce facts.
    *   *Analogy:* "The package has been shipped!" (an announcement).
*   **Request-Response Architecture:** Services **make requests** when they "need something" or want another service to "do something" and expect an immediate answer. They issue commands and await replies.
    *   *Analogy:* "Where is the package?" (a direct query).

Almost all advantages and disadvantages of EDA stem from this core difference. The decoupling, scalability, and resilience come from the asynchronous, broadcast nature of events, while the challenges in control, debugging, and consistency arise from the loss of direct, synchronous interaction.

**Historical and Modern Examples:**

*   **Older Systems:** Smalltalk (an object-oriented programming language) and Git (version control) are classic examples of systems that inherently use event-driven principles.
*   **Modern Systems:** React (JavaScript UI library) and Node.js (JavaScript runtime) are popular contemporary examples that heavily leverage event-driven programming paradigms for their asynchronous and reactive nature.

Understanding this fundamental distinction is key to deciding when and where Event-Driven Architecture is the most appropriate design choice for a system.
